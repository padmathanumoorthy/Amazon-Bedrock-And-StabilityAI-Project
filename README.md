# Amazon Bedrock and Stable Diffusion XL Demo Projects

In this demonstration I will show how to use the AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to 
create Generative AI images and simple video animations using 
* Amazon Bedrock 
* Stability.ai Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 model

# Amazon Bedrock

Amazon Bedrock, a fully managed service, brings together high-performing foundation models (FMs) from leading AI companies like Amazon, AI21 Labs, Anthropic, Cohere, Meta, Mistral AI, and Stability AI. It offers a single API, along with essential features like Guardrails, agents, and customization capabilities, ensuring security, privacy, and responsible AI in building generative AI applications. As of March 2024, it supports various FMs, including Stable Diffusion SDXL 0.8/1.0, catering to different modalities like text, vision, image, embeddings, and multimodal embeddings.
